# Introduction

Ever tried to work with Silverstripe from the command line, other then installing modules with composer?

Me neither. 

There is a 'sake' command to access the framework/cli-script.php, but it's possibilities are pretty limited.

Laravel has a beautiful set of 'artisan' console commands to interact with your application based on the Symfony Console Component.

And now we have the same power for Silverstripe!

If you know Laravel or Symfony, working with 'supersake' is a breeze.
If not, learning this command line tool, will let you work on the command line with Laravel and Symfony much easier.

Ain't that what PSR is all about?
